normal build instructions:
==========================

The generic build instructions can be found at INSTALL.

Some mathematic features are included from gsl, the GNU scientific library,
it is available at sources.redhat.com/gsl . All versions until gsl-0.7 are
supported now.

gsl and expat are distributed with Redhat 7.1 Linux.

so, configure is called with:

./configure --prefix=/as/you/like/it --with-gsl=/alternative/gsl/installation

build from svn:
===============

0. you need automake, autoconf and m4 from ftp://ftp.gnu.org

1. call autogen.sh
   (ignore messages like:
    automake: configure.in: installing `./mkinstalldirs'
        error while copying
   )

2. continue with normal build instructions as written in INSTALL

3. tests require DejaGNU (and this requires expect, a tcl based language)
