<h2>HMMEd: Hidden Markov Model editor</h2>


<p>HMMEd (the Hidden Markov Model editor) is a graphical application
which allows to create and edit Hidden Markov Models. Supported are
<ul>

<li> discrete emissions on arbitrary alphabets; this includes DNA,
RNA, and amino acids, and

<li> continous scalar emissions.

</ul>
</p>

<p>Discrete emission probabilities, as well as transition
probabilities can be graphically edited using pie charts with
handles. Parameters can also be entered directly. HMM topology can be
edited manually by adding/deleting states and connecting them with the
mouse.  Hierarchical models, i.e. super nodes corresponding to
complete promoters or codon models in gene finding HMMs, will be
supported.  Currently, a visually pleasant layout has to be done by
hand.</p>

<p>For models with continous emission, a graphical editor for mixtures
of pdfs is under development. A screenshot from a working prototype is
shown above. The handles underneath the pdfs change mean as well as
other pdf parameters, the pie chart controls the mixture
coefficients.</p>
