==============
General notes:
==============

These sources are going to be compiled, packed into a library and installed
on a local filesystem. That means, they are not recompiled for each program
they are linked against. This is the main difference to the old hmm/src
sources.

Required:

automake
autoconf
libtool
GNU make
GNU m4

=========================
Some notes for SVN usage:
=========================

Prepare the source tree for configuration:
==========================================

execute autogen.sh in order to derive all necessary configure tools.
This step needs automake and autoconf from GNU.

Then the source tree is ready for normal configuration.

There are some differences:

- The svn distribution may contain files, that are not included in the normal
  distribution. This file is an example. Force inclusion of a file by adding
  it to the variable EXTRA_DIST in Makefile.am in this directory.

- the copyright tags '__copyright__' are not substituted.


Create a distribution:
======================

All you need is:

make dist

This copies (or links) all necessary files into a seperate directory and
creates a tar.gz archive from it. Before doing this, configure your source
tree. The version number can be set in toplevel Makefile.am.

If you prefer the unpacked distribution tree, you can type

make distdir

In order to check, if all is set up correctly, you can use

make distcheck

That makes a distribution and tries to extratct, configure and build this
distribution.

Before the distribution is packed, a script substitutes all __copyright__
tags with the file contents COPYRIGHT.txt. awk is needed for this procedure.

Build procedure:
================

Please notice some pitfalls:

- Edit the right file:
Make changes only in the svn tree, all other changes are lost or overridden
automatically.
Make changes in the template file, the other files are derived from that file:

some Examples:
Makefile is generated from Makefile.in
Makefile.in is generated from Makefile.am

configure is generated from configure.in

config.h.in is generated from configure among others

Just type pwd if you are not sure.

- It is possible to seperate build process and sources:
create an own directory for this purpose and change the workdirectory to it:

mkdir ghmm-build
cd ghmm-build

call configure in the source tree from this directory:

../ghmm/configure

Now the build tree is ready. Execute make for the build process.
More about this topic in INSTALL.


clean up:
=========

there are different cleaning levels available in the makefile:

mostly-clean
clean
distclean
maintainer-clean

From top to bottom each level removes more files:

mostly-clean removes object files and core dumps
clean removes all targets (executables and documentation)
distclean deletes the host specific configuration
maintainer-clean deletes all autogenerated files
