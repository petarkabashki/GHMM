   Maximum A Posteriori Classification Algorithm (MAPCA).

   \obsolete given a field of models and one sequence and suppose the sequence
   has been produced by one of these models. This algorithm calculates
   for each model the probability, that the seq. comes from the model.
   This bayesian approach uses a prior for the models. If none is specified
   equal prob. is assumed.
   The maps are copied into "result", which has to be of dimension "smo_number"
