  Viterbi algorithm. Calculates the Viterbi path (the optimal path trough
  the model) and the Viterbi probability to a given model and a given 
  sequence. The matrices in the local_store struct are allocated using
  stat_matrix_d_alloc. In case of a model with silent states, the length of the viterbi 
  path is not identical with the sequence length. In such a case the end of the state path is
  marked by a -1 entry in the returned array. deprecated, use the argument pathlen instead
