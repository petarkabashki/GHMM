cidents and carelessnesses by which houses were set on fire with cautions against them and means proposed of avoiding them this was much spoken of as a useful piece and gave rise to a project which soon followed it of forming a company for the more ready extinguishing of fires and mutual assistance in removing and securing the goods when in danger associates in this scheme were presently found amounting to thirty our articles of agreement obligd every member to keep always in good order and fit for use a certain number of leather buckets with strong bags and baskets for packing and transporting of goods which were to be brought to every fire and we agreed to meet once a month and spend a social evening together in discoursing and communicating such ideas as occurred to us upon the subject of fires as might be useful in our conduct on such occasions the utility of this institution soon appeared and many more desiring to be admitted than we thought convenient for one company they were advised to form another which was accordingly done and this went on one new company being formed after another till they became so numerous as to include most of the inhabitants who were men of property and now at the time of my writing this tho upward of fifty years since its establishment that which i first formed called the union fire company still subsists and flourishes tho the first members are all deceasd but myself and one who is older by a year than i am the small fines that have been paid by members for absence at the monthly meetings have been applyd to the purchase of fireengines ladders firehooks and other useful implements for each company so that i question whether there is a city in the world better provided with the means of putting a stop to beginning conflagrations and in fact since these institutions the city has never lost by fire more than one or two houses at a time and the flames have often been extinguished before the house in which they began has been half consumed in  arrived among us from ireland the reverend mr whitefield who had made himself remarkable there as an itinerant preacher he was at first permitted to preach in some of our churches but the clergy taking a dislike to him soon refusd him their pulpits and he was obligd to preach in the fields the multitudes of all sects and denominations that attended his sermons were enormous and it was matter of speculation to me who was one of the number to observe the extraordinary influence of his oratory on his hearers and how much they admird and respected him notwithstanding his common abuse of them by assuring them that they were naturally half beasts and half devils it was wonderful to see the change soon made in the manners of our inhabitants from being thoughtless or indifferent about religion it seemd as if all the world were growing religious so that one could not walk thro the town in an evening without hearing psalms sung in different families of every street and it being found inconvenient to assemble in the open air subject to its inclemencies the building of a house to meet in was no sooner proposd and persons appointed to receive contributions but sufficient sums were soon receivd to procure the ground and erect the building which was one hundred feet long and seventy broad about the size of westminster hall and the work was carried on with such spirit as to be finished in a much shorter time than could have been expected both house and ground were vested in trustees expressly for the use of any preacher of any religious persuasion who might desire to say something to the people at philadelphia the design in building not being to accommodate any particular sect but the inhabitants in general so that even if the mufti of constantinople were to send a missionary to preach mohammedanism to us he would find a pulpit at his service mr whitefield in leaving us went preaching all the way thro the colonies to georgia the settlement of that province had lately been begun but instead of being made with hardy industrious husbandmen accustomed to labor the only people fit for such an enterprise it was with families of broken shopkeepers and other insolvent debtors many of indolent and idle habits taken out of the jails who being set down in the woods unqualified for clearing land and unable to endure the hardships of a new settlement perished in numbers leaving many helpless children unprovided for the sight of their miserable situation inspird the benevolent heart of mr whitefield with the idea of building an orphan house there in which they might be supported and educated returning northward he preachd up this charity and made large collections for his eloquence had a wonderful power over the hearts and purses of his hearers of which i myself was an instance i did not disapprove of the design but as georgia was then destitute of materials and workmen and it was proposed to send them from philadelphia at a great expense i thought it would have been better to have built the house here and brought the children to it this i advisd but he was resolute in his first project rejected my counsel and i therefore refusd to contribute i happened soon after to attend one of his sermons in the course of which i perceived he intended to finish with a collection and i silently resolved he should get nothing from me i had in my pocket a handful of copper money three or four silver dollars and five pistoles in gold as he proceeded i began to soften and concluded to give the coppers another stroke of his oratory made me ashamd of that and determind me to give the silver and he finishd so admirably that i emptyd my pocket wholly into the collectors dish gold and all at this sermon there was also one of our club who being of my sentiments respecting the building in georgia and suspecting a collection might be intended had by precaution emptied his pockets before he came from home towards the conclusion of the discourse however he felt a strong desire to give and applyd to a neighbour who stood near him to borrow some money for the purpose the application was unfortunately made to perhaps the only man in the company who had the firmness not to be affected by the preacher his answer was at any other time friend hopkinson i would lend to thee freely but not now for thee seems to be out of thy right senses some of mr whitefields enemies affected to suppose that he would apply these collections to his own private emolument but i who was intimately acquainted with him being employed in printing his sermons and journals etc never had the least suspicion of his integrity but am to this day decidedly of opinion that he was in all his conduct a perfectly honest man and methinks my testimony in his favour ought to have the more weight as we had no religious connection he usd indeed sometimes to pray for my conversion but never had the satisfaction of believing that his prayers were heard ours was a mere civil friendship sincere on both sides and lasted to his death the following instance will show something of the terms on which we stood upon one of his arrivals from england at boston he wrote to me that he should come soon to philadelphia but knew not where he could lodge when there as he understood his old friend and host mr benezet was removed to germantown my answer was you know my house if you can make shift with its scanty accommodations you will be most heartily welcome he replyd that if i made that kind offer for christs sake i should not miss of a reward and i returned dont let me be mistaken it was not for christs sake but for your sake one of our common acquaintance jocosely remarkd that knowing it to be the custom of the saints when they received any favour to shift the burden of the obligation from off their own shoulders and place it in heaven i had contrivd to fix it on earth the last time i saw mr whitefield was in london when he consulted me about his orphan house concern and his purpose of appropriating it to the establishment of a college he had a loud and clear voice and articulated his words and sentences so perfectly that he might be heard and understood at a great distance especially as his auditories however numerous observd the most exact silence he preachd one evening from the top of the courthouse steps which are in the middle of marketstreet and on the west side of secondstreet which crosses it at right angles both streets were filld with his hearers to a considerable distance being among the hindmost in marketstreet i had the curiosity to learn how far he could be heard by retiring backwards down the street towards the river and i found his voice distinct till i came near frontstreet when some noise in that street obscurd it imagining then a semicircle of which my distance should be the radius and that it were filld with auditors to each of whom i allowd two square feet i computed that he might well be heard by more than thirty thousand this reconcild me to the newspaper accounts of his having preachd to twentyfive thousand people in the fields and to the antient histories of generals haranguing whole armies of which i had sometimes doubted by hearing him often i came to distinguish easily between sermons newly composd and those which he had often preachd in the course of his travels his delivery of the latter was so improvd by frequent repetitions that every accent every emphasis every modulation of voice was so perfectly well turnd and well placd that without being interested in the subject one could not help being pleasd with the discourse a pleasure of much the same kind with that receivd from an excellent piece of musick this is an advantage itinerant preachers have over those who are stationary as the latter can not well improve their delivery of a sermon by so many rehearsals his writing and printing from time to time gave great advantage to his enemies unguarded expressions and even erroneous opinions delivered in preaching might have been afterwards explaind or qualifid by supposing others that might have accompanid them or they might have been denyd but litera scripta monet critics attackd his writings violently and with so much appearance of reason as to diminish the number of his votaries and prevent their encrease so that i am of opinion if he had never written any thing he would have left behind him a much more numerous and important sect and his reputation might in that case have been still growing even after his death as there being nothing of his writing on which to found a censure and give him a lower character his proselytes would be left at liberty to feign for him as great a variety of excellence as their enthusiastic admiration might wish him to have possessed my business was now continually augmenting and my circumstances growing daily easier my newspaper having become very profitable as being for a time almost the only one in this and the neighbouring provinces i experienced too the truth of the observation that after getting the first hundred pound it is more easy to get the second money itself being of a prolific nature the partnership at carolina having succeeded i was encouragd to engage in others and to promote several of my workmen who had behaved well by establishing them with printinghouses in different colonies on the same terms with that in carolina most of them did well being enabled at the end of our term six years to purchase the types of me and go on working for themselves by which means several families were raised partnerships often finish in quarrels but i was happy in this that mine were all carried on and ended amicably owing i think a good deal to the precaution of having very explicitly settled in our articles every thing to be done by or expected from each partner so that there was nothing to dispute which precaution i would therefore recommend to all who enter into partnerships for whatever esteem partners may have for and confidence in each other at the time of the contract little jealousies and disgusts may arise with ideas of inequality in the care and burden of the business etc which are attended often with breach of friendship and of the connection perhaps with lawsuits and other disagreeable consequences i had on the whole abundant reason to be satisfied with my being established in pennsylvania there were however two things that i regretted there being no provision for defense nor for a compleat education of youth no militia nor any college i therefore in  drew up a proposal for establishing an academy and at that time thinking the reverend mr peters who was out of employ a fit person to superintend such an institution i communicated the project to him but he having more profitable views in the service of the proprietaries which succeeded declind the undertaking and not knowing another at that time suitable for such a trust i let the scheme lie a while dormant i succeeded better the next year  in proposing and establishing a philosophical society the paper i wrote for that purpose will be found among my writings when collected with respect to defense spain having been several years at war against great britain and being at length joind by france which brought us into great danger and the laboured and longcontinued endeavour of our governor thomas to prevail with our quaker assembly to pass a militia law and make other provisions for the security of the province having proved abortive i determined to try what might be done by a voluntary association of the people to promote this i first wrote and published a pamphlet entitled plain truth in which i stated our defenceless situation in strong lights with the necessity of union and discipline for our defense and promisd to propose in a few days an association to be generally signed for that purpose the pamphlet had a sudden and surprising effect i was calld upon for the instrument of association and having settled the draft of it with a few friends i appointed a meeting of the citizens in the large building before mentioned the house was pretty full i had prepared a number of printed copies and provided pens and ink dispersd all over the room i harangued them a little on the subject read the paper and explained it and then distributed the copies which were eagerly signed not the least objection being made when the company separated and the papers were collected we found above twelve hundred hands and other copies being dispersed in the country the subscribers amounted at length to upward of ten thousand these all furnished themselves as soon as they could with arms formed themselves into companies and regiments chose their own officers and met every week to be instructed in the manual exercise and other parts of military discipline the women by subscriptions among themselves provided silk colors which they presented to the companies painted with different devices and mottos which i supplied the officers of the companies composing the philadelphia regiment being met chose me for their colonel but conceiving myself unfit i declind that station and recommended mr lawrence a fine person and man of influence who was accordingly appointed i then proposd a lottery to defray the expense of building a battery below the town and furnishing it with cannon it filled expeditiously and the battery was soon erected the merlons being framd of logs and filld with earth we bought some old cannon from boston but these not being sufficient we wrote to england for more soliciting at the same time our proprietaries for some assistance tho without much expectation of obtaining it meanwhile colonel lawrence william allen abram taylor esqr and myself were sent to new york by the associators commissiond to borrow some cannon of governor clinton he at first refusd us peremptorily but at dinner with his council where there was great drinking of madeira wine as the custom of that place then was he softened by degrees and said he would lend us six after a few more bumpers he advancd to ten and at length he very goodnaturedly conceded eighteen they were fine cannon eighteenpounders with their carriages which we soon transported and mounted on our battery where the associators kept a nightly guard while the war lasted and among the rest i regularly took my turn of duty there as a common soldier my activity in these operations was agreeable to the governor and council they took me into confidence and i was consulted by them in every measure wherein their concurrence was thought useful to the association calling in the aid of religion i proposd to them the proclaiming a fast to promote reformation and implore the blessing of heaven on our undertaking they embracd the motion but as it was the first fast ever thought of in the province the secretary had no precedent from which to draw the proclamation my education in new england where a fast is proclaimed every year was here of some advantage i drew it in the accustomed stile it was translated into german printed in both languages and divulgd thro the province this gave the clergy of the different sects an opportunity of influencing their congregations to join in the association and it would probably have been general among all but quakers if the peace had not soon intervend it was thought by some of my friends that by my activity in these affairs i should offend that sect and thereby lose my interest in the assembly of the province where they formed a great majority a young gentleman who had likewise some friends in the house and wished to succeed me as their clerk acquainted me that it was decided to displace me at the next election and he therefore in good will advisd me to resign as more consistent with my honour than being turnd out my answer to him was that i had read or heard of some public man who made it a rule never to ask for an office and never to refuse one when offerd to him i approve says i of his rule and will practice it with a small addition i shall never ask never refuse nor ever resign an office if they will have my office of clerk to dispose of to another they shall take it from me i will not by giving it up lose my right of some time or other making reprisals on my adversaries i heard however no more of this i was chosen again unanimously as usual at the next election possibly as they dislikd my late intimacy with the members of council who had joind the governors in all the disputes about military preparations with which the house had long been harassd they might have been pleasd if i would voluntarily have left them but they did not care to displace me on account merely of my zeal for the association and they could not well give another reason indeed i had some cause to believe that the defense of the country was not disagreeable to any of them provided they were not requird to assist in it and i found that a much greater number of them than i could have imagined tho against offensive war were clearly for the defensive many pamphlets pro and con were publishd on the subject and some by good quakers in favour of defense which i believe convincd most of their younger people a transaction in our fire company gave me some insight into their prevailing sentiments it had been proposd that we should encourage the scheme for building a battery by laying out the present stock then about sixty pounds in tickets of the lottery by our rules no money could be disposd of till the next meeting after the proposal the company consisted of thirty members of which twentytwo were quakers and eight only of other persuasions we eight punctually attended the meeting but tho we thought that some of the quakers would join us we were by no means sure of a majority only one quaker mr james morris appeard to oppose the measure he expressed much sorrow that it had ever been proposd as he said friends were all against it and it would create such discord as might break up the company we told him that we saw no reason for that we were the minority and if friends were against the measure and outvoted us we must and should agreeably to the usage of all societies submit when the hour for business arrivd it was movd to put the vote he allowd we might then do it by the rules but as he could assure us that a number of members intended to be present for the purpose of opposing it it would be but candid to allow a little time for their appearing while we were disputing this a waiter came to tell me two gentlemen below desird to speak with me i went down and found they were two of our quaker members they told me there were eight of them assembled at a tavern just by that they were determind to come and vote with us if there should be occasion which they hopd would not be the case and desird we would not call for their assistance if we could do without it as their voting for such a measure might embroil them with their elders and friends being thus secure of a majority i went up and after a little seeming hesitation agreed to a delay of another hour this mr morris allowd to be extreamly fair not one of his opposing friends appeard at which he expressd great surprize and at the expiration of the hour we carryd the resolution eight to one and as of the twentytwo quakers eight were ready to vote with us and thirteen by their absence manifested that they were not inclind to oppose the measure i afterward estimated the proportion of quakers sincerely against defense as one to twentyone only for these were all regular members of that society and in good reputation among them and had due notice of what was proposd at that meeting the honorable and learned mr logan who had always been of that sect was one who wrote an address to them declaring his approbation of defensive war and supporting his opinion by many strong arguments he put into my hands sixty pounds to be laid out in lottery tickets for the battery with directions to apply what prizes might be drawn wholly to that service he told me the following anecdote of his old master william penn respecting defense he came over from england when a young man with that proprietary and as his secretary it was wartime and their ship was chasd by an armed vessel supposd to be an enemy their captain prepard for defense but told william penn and his company of quakers that he did not expect their assistance and they might retire into the cabin which they did except james logan who chose to stay upon deck and was quarterd to a gun the supposd enemy provd a friend so there was no fighting but when the secretary went down to communicate the intelligence william penn rebukd him severely for staying upon deck and undertaking to assist in defending the vessel contrary to the principles of friends especially as it had not been required by the captain this reproof being before all the company piqud the secretary who answerd i being thy servant why did thee not order me to come down but thee was willing enough that i should stay and help to fight the ship when thee thought there was danger my being many years in the assembly the majority of which were constantly quakers gave me frequent opportunities of seeing the embarrassment given them by their principle against war whenever application was made to them by order of the crown to grant aids for military purposes they were unwilling to offend government on the one hand by a direct refusal and their friends the body of the quakers on the other by a compliance contrary to their principles hence a variety of evasions to avoid complying and modes of disguising the compliance when it became unavoidable the common mode at last was to grant money under the phrase of its being for the kings use and never to inquire how it was applied but if the demand was not directly from the crown that phrase was found not so proper and some other was to be invented as when powder was wanting i think it was for the garrison at louisburg and the government of new england solicited a grant of some from pennsilvania which was much urgd on the house by governor thomas they could not grant money to buy powder because that was an ingredient of war but they voted an aid to new england of three thousand pounds to be put into the hands of the governor and appropriated it for the purchasing of bread flour wheat or other grain some of the council desirous of giving the house still further embarrassment advisd the governor not to accept provision as not being the thing he had demanded but be replyd i shall take the money for i understand very well their meaning other grain is gunpowder which he accordingly bought and they never objected to it  see the votesmarg note it was in allusion to this fact that when in our fire company we feared the success of our proposal in favour of the lottery and i had said to my friend mr syng one of our members if we fail let us move the purchase of a fireengine with the money the quakers can have no objection to that and then if you nominate me and i you as a committee for that purpose we will buy a great gun which is certainly a fireengine i see says he you have improvd by being so long in the assembly your equivocal project would be just a match for their wheat or other grain these embarrassments that the quakers sufferd from having establishd and published it as one of their principles that no kind of war was lawful and which being once published they could not afterwards however they might change their minds easily get rid of reminds me of what i think a more prudent conduct in another sect among us that of the dunkers i was acquainted with one of its founders michael welfare soon after it appeard he complaind to me that they were grievously calumniated by the zealots of other persuasions and chargd with abominable principles and practices to which they were utter strangers i told him this had always been the case with new sects and that to put a stop to such abuse i imagind it might be well to publish the articles of their belief and the rules of their discipline he said that it had been proposd among them but not agreed to for this reason when we were first drawn together as a society says he it had pleased god to enlighten our minds so far as to see that some doctrines which we once esteemed truths were errors and that others which we had esteemed errors were real truths from time to time he has been pleased to afford us farther light and our principles have been improving and our errors diminishing now we are not sure that we are arrived at the end of this progression and at the perfection of spiritual or theological knowledge and we fear that if we should once print our confession of faith we should feel ourselves as if bound and confind by it and perhaps be unwilling to receive farther improvement and our successors still more so as conceiving what we their elders and founders had done to be something sacred never to be departed from this modesty in a sect is perhaps a singular instance in the history of mankind every other sect supposing itself in possession of all truth and that those who differ are so far in the wrong like a man traveling in foggy weather those at some distance before him on the road he sees wrapped up in the fog as well as those behind him and also the people in the fields on each side but near him all appears clear tho in truth he is as much in the fog as any of them to avoid this kind of embarrassment the quakers have of late years been gradually declining the public service in the assembly and in the magistracy choosing rather to quit their power than their principle in order of time i should have mentioned before that having in  invented an open stove for the better warming of rooms and at the same time saving fuel as the fresh air admitted was warmed in entering i made a present of the model to mr robert grace one of my early friends who having an ironfurnace found the casting of the plates for these stoves a profitable thing as they were growing in demand to promote that demand i wrote and published a pamphlet entitled an account of the newinvented pennsylvania fireplaces wherein their construction and manner of operation is particularly explained their advantages above every other method of warming rooms demonstrated and all objections that have been raised against the use of them answered and obviated etc this pamphlet had a good effect govr thomas was so pleasd with the construction of this stove as described in it that he offered to give me a patent for the sole vending of them for a term of years but i declind it from a principle which has ever weighed with me on such occasions viz that as we enjoy great advantages from the inventions of others we should be glad of an opportunity to serve others by any invention of ours and this we should do freely and generously an ironmonger in london however assuming a good deal of my pamphlet and working it up into his own and making some small changes in the machine which rather hurt its operation got a patent for it there and made as i was told a little fortune by it and this is not the only instance of patents taken out for my inventions by others tho not always with the same success which i never contested as having no desire of profiting by patents myself and hating disputes the use of these fireplaces in very many houses both of this and the neighbouring colonies has been and is a great saving of wood to the inhabitants peace being concluded and the association business therefore at an end i turnd my thoughts again to the affair of establishing an academy the first step i took was to associate in the design a number of active friends of whom the junto furnished a good part the next was to write and publish a pamphlet entitled proposals relating to the education of youth in pennsylvania this i distributed among the principal inhabitants gratis and as soon as i could suppose their minds a little prepared by the perusal of it i set on foot a subscription for opening and supporting an academy it was to be paid in quotas yearly for five years by so dividing it i judgd the subscription might be larger and i believe it was so amounting to no less if i remember right than five thousand pounds in the introduction to these proposals i stated their publication not as an act of mine but of some publickspirited gentlemen avoiding as much as i could according to my usual rule the presenting myself to the publick as the author of any scheme for their benefit the subscribers to carry the project into immediate execution chose out of their number twentyfour trustees and appointed mr francis then attorneygeneral and myself to draw up constitutions for the government of the academy which being done and signed a house was hired masters engagd and the schools opened i think in the same year  the scholars increasing fast the house was soon found too small and we were looking out for a piece of ground properly situated with intention to build when providence threw into our way a large house ready built which with a few alterations might well serve our purpose this was the building before mentioned erected by the hearers of mr whitefield and was obtained for us in the following manner it is to be noted that the contributions to this building being made by people of different sects care was taken in the nomination of trustees in whom the building and ground was to be vested that a predominancy should not be given to any sect lest in time that predominancy might be a means of appropriating the whole to the use of such sect contrary to the original intention it was therefore that one of each sect was appointed viz one churchofengland man one presbyterian one baptist one moravian etc those in case of vacancy by death were to fill it by election from among the contributors the moravian happend not to please his colleagues and on his death they resolved to have no other of that sect the difficulty then was how to avoid having two of some other sect by means of the new choice several persons were named and for that reason not agreed to at length one mentiond me with the observation that i was merely an honest man and of no sect at all which prevaild with them to chuse me the enthusiasm which existed when the house was built had long since abated and its trustees had not been able to procure fresh contributions for paying the groundrent and discharging some other debts the building had occasiond which embarrassd them greatly being now a member of both sets of trustees that for the building and that for the academy i had a good opportunity of negotiating with both and brought them finally to an agreement by which the trustees for the building were to cede it to those of the academy the latter undertaking to discharge the debt to keep for ever open in the building a large hall for occasional preachers according to the original intention and maintain a free school for the instruction of poor children writings were accordingly drawn and on paying the debts the trustees of the academy were put in possession of the premises and by dividing the great and lofty hall into stories and different rooms above and below for the several schools and purchasing some additional ground the whole was soon made fit for our purpose and the scholars removd into the building the care and trouble of agreeing with the workmen purchasing materials and superintending the work fell upon me and i went thro it the more cheerfully as it did not then interfere with my private business having the year before taken a very able industrious and honest partner mr david hall with whose character i was well acquainted as he had workd for me four years he took off my hands all care of the printingoffice paying me punctually my share of the profits this partnership continued eighteen years successfully for us both the trustees of the academy after a while were incorporated by a charter from the governor their funds were increasd by contributions in britain and grants of land from the proprietaries to which the assembly has since made considerable addition and thus was established the present university of philadelphia i have been continued one of its trustees from the beginning now near forty years and have had the very great pleasure of seeing a number of the youth who have receivd their education in it distinguishd by their improvd abilities serviceable in public stations and ornaments to their country when i disengaged myself as above mentioned from private business i flatterd myself that by the sufficient tho moderate fortune i had acquird i had secured leisure during the rest of my life for philosophical studies and amusements i purchased all dr spences apparatus who had come from england to lecture here and i proceeded in my electrical experiments with great alacrity but the publick now considering me as a man of leisure laid hold of me for their purposes every part of our civil government and almost at the same time imposing some duty upon me the governor put me into the commission of the peace the corporation of the city chose me of the common council and soon after an alderman and the citizens at large chose me a burgess to represent them in assembly this latter station was the more agreeable to me as i was at length tired with sitting there to hear debates in which as clerk i could take no part and which were often so unentertaining that i was inducd to amuse myself with making magic squares or circles or any thing to avoid weariness and i conceivd my becoming a member would enlarge my power of doing good i would not however insinuate that my ambition was not flatterd by all these promotions it certainly was for considering my low beginning they were great things to me and they were still more pleasing as being so many spontaneous testimonies of the public good opinion and by me entirely unsolicited the office of justice of the peace i tryd a little by attending a few courts and sitting on the bench to hear causes but finding that more knowledge of the common law than i possessd was necessary to act in that station with credit i gradually withdrew from it excusing myself by my being obligd to attend the higher duties of a legislator in the assembly my election to this trust was repeated every year for ten years without my ever asking any elector for his vote or signifying either directly or indirectly any desire of being chosen on taking my seat in the house my son was appointed their clerk the year following a treaty being to be held with the indians at carlisle the governor sent a message to the house proposing that they should nominate some of their members to be joind with some members of council as commissioners for that purpose the house named the speaker mr norris and myself and being commissiond we went to carlisle and met the indians accordingly  see the votes to have this more correctly marg note as those people are extreamly apt to get drunk and when so are very quarrelsome and disorderly we strictly forbad the selling any liquor to them and when they complaind of this restriction we told them that if they would continue sober during the treaty we would give them plenty of rum when business was over they promisd this and they kept their promise because they could get no liquor and the treaty was conducted very orderly and concluded to mutual satisfaction they then claimd and receivd the rum this was in the afternoon they were near one hundred men women and children and were lodgd in temporary cabins built in the form of a square just without the town in the evening hearing a great noise among them the commissioners walkd out to see what was the matter we found they had made a great bonfire in the middle of the square they were all drunk men and women quarreling and fighting their darkcolourd bodies half naked seen only by the gloomy light of the bonfire running after and beating one another with firebrands accompanied by their horrid yellings formd a scene the most resembling our ideas of hell that could well be imagind there was no appeasing the tumult and we retired to our lodging at midnight a number of them came thundering at our door demanding more rum of which we took no notice the next day sensible they had misbehavd in giving us that disturbance they sent three of their old counselors to make their apology the orator acknowledgd the fault but laid it upon the rum and then endeavored to excuse the rum by saying the great spirit who made all things made every thing for some use and whatever use he designd any thing for that use it should always be put to now when he made rum he said let this be for the indians to get drunk with and it must be so and indeed if it be the design of providence to extirpate these savages in order to make room for cultivators of the earth it seems not improbable that rum may be the appointed means it has already annihilated all the tribes who formerly inhabited the seacoast in  dr thomas bond a particular friend of mine conceived the idea of establishing a hospital in philadelphia a very beneficent design which has been ascribd to me but was originally his for the reception and cure of poor sick persons whether inhabitants of the province or strangers he was zealous and active in endeavouring to procure subscriptions for it but the proposal being a novelty in america and at first not well understood he met with but small success at length he came to me with the compliment that he found there was no such thing as carrying a publicspirited project through without my being concernd in it for says he i am often askd by those to whom i propose subscribing have you consulted franklin upon this business and what does he think of it and when i tell them that i have not supposing it rather out of your line they do not subscribe but say they will consider of it i enquired into the nature and probable utility of his scheme and receiving from him a very satisfactory explanation i not only subscribd to it myself but engagd heartily in the design of procuring subscriptions from others previously however to the solicitation i endeavoured to prepare the minds of the people by writing on the subject in the newspapers which was my usual custom in such cases but which he had omitted the subscriptions afterwards were more free and generous but beginning to flag i saw they would be insufficient without some assistance from the assembly and therefore proposd to petition for it which was done the country members did not at first relish the project they objected that it could only be serviceable to the city and therefore the citizens alone should be at the expense of it and they doubted whether the citizens themselves generally approvd of it my allegation on the contrary that it met with such approbation as to leave no doubt of our being able to raise two thousand pounds by voluntary donations they considered as a most extravagant supposition and utterly impossible on this i formd my plan and asking leave to bring in a bill for incorporating the contributors according to the prayer of their petition and granting them a blank sum of money which leave was obtained chiefly on the consideration that the house could throw the bill out if they did not like it i drew it so as to make the important clause a conditional one viz and be it enacted by the authority aforesaid that when the said contributors shall have met and chosen their managers and treasurer and shall have raised by their contributions a capital stock of  value the yearly interest of which is to be applied to the accommodating of the sick poor in the said hospital free of charge for diet attendance advice and medicines and shall make the same appear to the satisfaction of the speaker of the assembly for the time being that then it shall and may be lawful for the said speaker and he is hereby required to sign an order on the provincial treasurer for the payment of two thousand pounds in two yearly payments to the treasurer of the said hospital to be applied to the founding building and finishing of the same this condition carried the bill through for the members who had opposd the grant and now conceivd they might have the credit of being charitable without the expence agreed to its passage and then in soliciting subscriptions among the people we urgd the conditional promise of the law as an additional motive to give since every mans donation would be doubled thus the clause workd both ways the subscriptions accordingly soon exceeded the requisite sum and we claimd and receivd the public gift which enabled us to carry the design into execution a convenient and handsome building was soon erected the institution has by constant experience been found useful and flourishes to this day and i do not remember any of my political manoeuvres the success of which gave me at the time more pleasure or wherein after thinking of it i more easily excusd myself for having made some use of cunning it was about this time that another projector the rev gilbert tennent came to me with a request that i would assist him in procuring a subscription for erecting a new meetinghouse it was to be for the use of a congregation he had gathered among the presbyterians who were originally disciples of mr whitefield unwilling to make myself disagreeable to my fellowcitizens by too frequently soliciting their contributions i absolutely refusd he then desired i would furnish him with a list of the names of persons i knew by experience to be generous and publicspirited i thought it would be unbecoming in me after their kind compliance with my solicitations to mark them out to be worried by other beggars and therefore refusd also to give such a list he then desird i would at least give him my advice that i will readily do said i and in the first place i advise you to apply to all those whom you know will give something next to those whom you are uncertain whether they will give any thing or not and show them the list of those who have given and lastly do not neglect those who you are sure will give nothing for in some of them you may be mistaken he laughd and thankd me and said he would take my advice he did so for he askd of everybody and he obtained a much larger sum than he expected with which he erected the capacious and very elegant meetinghouse that stands in archstreet our city tho laid out with a beautiful regularity the streets large strait and crossing each other at right angles had the disgrace of suffering those streets to remain long unpavd and in wet weather the wheels of heavy carriages ploughd them into a quagmire so that it was difficult to cross them and in dry weather the dust was offensive i had livd near what was calld the jersey market and saw with pain the inhabitants wading in mud while purchasing their provisions a strip of ground down the middle of that market was at length pavd with brick so that being once in the market they had firm footing but were often over shoes in dirt to get there by talking and writing on the subject i was at length instrumental in getting the street pavd with stone between the market and the brickd footpavement that was on each side next the houses this for some time gave an easy access to the market dryshod but the rest of the street not being pavd whenever a carriage came out of the mud upon this pavement it shook off and left its dirt upon it and it was soon coverd with mire which was not removd the city as yet having no scavengers after some inquiry i found a poor industrious man who was willing to undertake keeping the pavement clean by sweeping it twice a week carrying off the dirt from before all the neighbours doors for the sum of sixpence per month to be paid by each house i then wrote and printed a paper setting forth the advantages to the neighbourhood that might be obtaind by this small expense the greater ease in keeping our houses clean so much dirt not being brought in by peoples feet the benefit to the shops by more custom etc etc as buyers could more easily get at them and by not having in windy weather the dust blown in upon their goods etc etc i sent one of these papers to each house and in a day or two went round to see who would subscribe an agreement to pay these sixpences it was unanimously signd and for a time well executed all the inhabitants of the city were delighted with the cleanliness of the pavement that surrounded the market it being a convenience to all and this raisd a general desire to have all the streets paved and made the people more willing to submit to a tax for that purpose after some time i drew a bill for paving the city and brought it into the assembly it was just before i went to england in  and did not pass till i was gone and then with an alteration in the mode of assessment which i thought not for the better but with an additional provision for lighting as well as paving the streets which was a great improvement it was by a private person the late mr john clifton his giving a sample of the utility of lamps by placing one at his door that the people were first impressd with the idea of enlighting all the city the honour of this public benefit has also been ascribd to me but it belongs truly to that gentleman i did but follow his example and have only some merit to claim respecting the form of our lamps as differing from the globe lamps we were at first supplyd with from london those we found inconvenient in these respects they admitted no air below the smoke therefore did not readily go out above but circulated in the globe lodgd on its inside and soon obstructed the light they were intended to afford giving besides the daily trouble of wiping them clean and an accidental stroke on one of them would demolish it and render it totally useless i therefore suggested the composing them of four flat panes with a long funnel above to draw up the smoke and crevices admitting air below to facilitate the ascent of the smoke by this means they were kept clean and did not grow dark in a few hours as the london lamps do but continud bright till morning and an accidental stroke would generally break but a single pane easily repaird  see votes i have sometimes wonderd that the londoners did not from the effect holes in the bottom of the globe lamps usd at vauxhall have in keeping them clean learn to have such holes in their street lamps but these holes being made for another purpose viz to communicate flame more suddenly to the wick by a little flax hanging down thro them the other use of letting in air seems not to have been thought of and therefore after the lamps have been lit a few hours the streets of london are very poorly illuminated the mention of these improvements puts me in mind of one i proposd when in london to dr fothergill who was among the best men i have known and a great promoter of useful projects i had observd that the streets when dry were never swept and the light dust carried away but it was sufferd to accumulate till wet weather reducd it to mud and then after lying some days so deep on the pavement that there was no crossing but in paths kept clean by poor people with brooms it was with great labour rakd together and thrown up into carts open above the sides of which sufferd some of the slush at every jolt on the pavement to shake out and fall sometimes to the annoyance of footpassengers the reason given for not sweeping the dusty streets was that the dust would fly into the windows of shops and houses an accidental occurrence had instructed me how much sweeping might be done in a little time i found at my door in cravenstreet one morning a poor woman sweeping my pavement with a birch broom she appeared very pale and feeble as just come out of a fit of sickness i askd who employd her to sweep there she said nobody but i am very poor and in distress and i sweeps before gentlefolkses doors and hopes they will give me something i bid her sweep the whole street clean and i would give her a shilling this was at nine oclock at  she came for the shilling from the slowness i saw at first in her working i could scarce believe that the work was done so soon and sent my servant to examine it who reported that the whole street was swept perfectly clean and all the dust placd in the gutter which was in the middle and the next rain washd it quite away so that the pavement and even the kennel were perfectly clean i then judgd that if that feeble woman could sweep such a street in three hours a strong active man might have done it in half the time and here let me remark the convenience of having but one gutter in such a narrow street running down its middle instead of two one on each side near the footway for where all the rain that falls on a street runs from the sides and meets in the middle it forms there a current strong enough to wash away all the mud it meets with but when divided into two channels it is often too weak to cleanse either and only makes the mud it finds more fluid so that the wheels of carriages and feet of horses throw and dash it upon the footpavement which is thereby rendered foul and slippery and sometimes splash it upon those who are walking my proposal communicated to the good doctor was as follows for the more effectual cleaning and keeping clean the streets of london and westminster it is proposed that the several watchmen be contracted with to have the dust swept up in dry seasons and the mud rakd up at other times each in the several streets and lanes of his round that they be furnishd with brooms and other proper instruments for these purposes to be kept at their respective stands ready to furnish the poor people they may employ in the service that in the dry summer months the dust be all swept up into heaps at proper distances before the shops and windows of houses are usually opened when the scavengers with closecovered carts shall also carry it all away that the mud when rakd up be not left in heaps to be spread abroad again by the wheels of carriages and trampling of horses but that the scavengers be provided with bodies of carts not placd high upon wheels but low upon sliders with lattice bottoms which being coverd with straw will retain the mud thrown into them and permit the water to drain from it whereby it will become much lighter water making the greatest part of its weight these bodies of carts to be placd at convenient distances and the mud brought to them in wheelbarrows they remaining where placd till the mud is draind and then horses brought to draw them away i have since had doubts of the practicability of the latter part of this proposal on account of the narrowness of some streets and the difficulty of placing the drainingsleds so as not to encumber too much the passage but i am still of opinion that the former requiring the dust to be swept up and carryd away before the shops are open is very practicable in the summer when the days are long for in walking thro the strand and fleetstreet one morning at seven oclock i observd there was not one shop open tho it had been daylight and the sun up above three hours the inhabitants of london chusing voluntarily to live much by candlelight and sleep by sunshine and yet often complain a little absurdly of the duty on candles and the high price of tallow some may think these trifling matters not worth minding or relating but when they consider that tho dust blown into the eyes of a single person or into a single shop on a windy day is but of small importance yet the great number of the instances in a populous city and its frequent repetitions give it weight and consequence perhaps they will not censure very severely those who bestow some attention to affairs of this seemingly low nature human felicity is producd not so much by great pieces of good fortune that seldom happen as by little advantages that occur every day thus if you teach a poor young man to shave himself and keep his razor in order you may contribute more to the happiness of his life than in giving him a thousand guineas the money may be soon spent the regret only remaining of having foolishly consumed it but in the other case he escapes the frequent vexation of waiting for barbers and of their sometimes dirty fingers offensive breaths and dull razors he shaves when most convenient to him and enjoys daily the pleasure of its being done with a good instrument with these sentiments i have hazarded the few preceding pages hoping they may afford hints which some time or other may be useful to a city i love having lived many years in it very happily and perhaps to some of our towns in america having been for some time employed by the postmastergeneral of america as his comptroller in regulating several offices and bringing the officers to account i was upon his death in  appointed jointly with mr william hunter to succeed him by a commission from the postmastergeneral in england the american office never had hitherto paid any thing to that of britain we were to have six hundred pounds a year between us if we could make that sum out of the profits of the office to do this a variety of improvements were necessary some of these were inevitably at first expensive so that in the first four years the office became above nine hundred pounds in debt to us but it soon after began to repay us and before i was displacd by a freak of the ministers of which i shall speak hereafter we had brought it to yield three times as much clear revenue to the crown as the postoffice of ireland since that imprudent transaction they have receivd from itnot one farthing the business of the postoffice occasiond my taking a journey this year to new england where the college of cambridge of their own motion presented me with the degree of master of arts yale college in connecticut had before made me a similar compliment thus without studying in any college i came to partake of their honours they were conferrd in consideration of my improvements and discoveries in the electric branch of natural philosophy in  war with france being again apprehended a congress of commissioners from the different colonies was by an order of the lords of trade to be assembled at albany there to confer with the chiefs of the six nations concerning the means of defending both their country and ours governor hamilton having receivd this order acquainted the house with it requesting they would furnish proper presents for the indians to be given on this occasion and naming the speaker mr norris and myself to join mr thomas penn and mr secretary peters as commissioners to act for pennsylvania the house approvd the nomination and provided the goods for the present and tho they did not much like treating out of the provinces and we met the other commissioners at albany about the middle of june in our way thither i projected and drew a plan for the union of all the colonies under one government so far as might be necessary for defense and other important general purposes as we passd thro new york i had there shown my project to mr james alexander and mr kennedy two gentlemen of great knowledge in public affairs and being fortified by their approbation i venturd to lay it before the congress it then appeared that several of the commissioners had formd plans of the same kind a previous question was first taken whether a union should be established which passd in the affirmative unanimously a committee was then appointed one member from each colony to consider the several plans and report mine happend to be preferrd and with a few amendments was accordingly reported by this plan the general government was to be administered by a presidentgeneral appointed and supported by the crown and a grand council was to be chosen by the representatives of the people of the several colonies met in their respective assemblies the debates upon it in congress went on daily hand in hand with the indian business many objections and difficulties were started but at length they were all overcome and the plan was unanimously agreed to and copies ordered to be transmitted to the board of trade and to the assemblies of the several provinces its fate was singular the assemblies did not adopt it as they all thought there was too much prerogative in it and in england it was judgd to have too much of the democratic the board of trade therefore did not approve of it nor recommend it for the approbation of his majesty but another scheme was formd supposed to answer the same purpose better whereby the governors of the provinces with some members of their respective councils were to meet and order the raising of troops building of forts etc and to draw on the treasury of great britain for the expense which was afterwards to be refunded by an act of parliament laying a tax on america my plan with my reasons in support of it is to be found among my political papers that are printed being the winter following in boston i had much conversation with governor shirley upon both the plans part of what passed between us on the occasion may also be seen among those papers the different and contrary reasons of dislike to my plan makes me suspect that it was really the true medium and i am still of opinion it would have been happy for both sides the water if it had been adopted the colonies so united would have been sufficiently strong to have defended themselves there would then have been no need of troops from england of course the subsequent pretence for taxing america and the bloody contest it occasioned would have been avoided but such mistakes are not new history is full of the errors of states and princes look round the habitable world how few know their own good or knowing it pursue those who govern having much business on their hands do not generally like to take the trouble of considering and carrying into execution new projects the best public measures are therefore seldom adopted from previous wisdom but forcd by the occasion the governor of pennsylvania in sending it down to the assembly expressd his approbation of the plan as appearing to him to be drawn up with great clearness and strength of judgment and therefore recommended it as well worthy of their closest and most serious attention the house however by the management of a certain member took it up when i happend to be absent which i thought not very fair and reprobated it without paying any attention to it at all to my no small mortification in my journey to boston this year i met at new york with our new governor mr morris just arrivd there from england with whom i had been before intimately acquainted he brought a commission to supersede mr hamilton who tird with the disputes his proprietary instructions subjected him to had resignd mr morris askd me if i thought he must expect as uncomfortable an administration i said no you may on the contrary have a very comfortable one if you will only take care not to enter into any dispute with the assembly my dear friend says he pleasantly how can you advise my avoiding disputes you know i love disputing it is one of my greatest pleasures however to show the regard i have for your counsel i promise you i will if possible avoid them he had some reason for loving to dispute being eloquent an acute sophister and therefore generally successful in argumentative conversation he had been brought up to it from a boy his father as i have heard accustoming his children to dispute with one another for his diversion while sitting at table after dinner but i think the practice was not wise for in the course of my observation these disputing contradicting and confuting people are generally unfortunate in their affairs they get victory sometimes but they never get good will which would be of more use to them we parted he going to philadelphia and i to boston in returning i met at new york with the votes of the assembly by which it appeard that notwithstanding his promise to me he and the house were already in high contention and it was a continual battle between them as long as he retaind the government i had my share of it for as soon as i got back to my seat in the assembly i was put on every committee for answering his speeches and messages and by the committees always desired to make the drafts our answers as well as his messages were often tart and sometimes indecently abusive and as he knew i wrote for the assembly one might have imagined that when we met we could hardly avoid cutting throats but he was so goodnaturd a man that no personal difference between him and me was occasiond by the contest and we often dind together one afternoon in the height of this public quarrel we met in the street franklin says he you must go home with me and spend the evening i am to have some company that you will like and taking me by the arm he led me to his house in gay conversation over our wine after supper he told us jokingly that he much admird the idea of sancho panza who when it was proposed to give him a government requested it might be a government of blacks as then if he could not agree with his people he might sell them one of his friends who sat next to me says franklin why do you continue to side with these damnd quakers had not you better sell them the proprietor would give you a good price the governor says i has not yet blacked them enough he indeed had labored hard to blacken the assembly in all his messages but they wipd off his coloring as fast as he laid it on and placd it in return thick upon his own face so that finding he was likely to be negrofied himself he as well as mr hamilton grew tird of the contest and quitted the government these public quarrels were all at bottom owing to the proprietaries our hereditary governors who when any expense was to be incurred for the defense of their province with incredible meanness instructed their deputies to pass no act for levying the necessary taxes unless their vast estates were in the same act expressly excused and they had even taken bonds of these deputies to observe such instructions the assemblies for three years held out against this injustice tho constrained to bend at last at length captain denny who was governor morriss successor ventured to disobey those instructions how that was brought about i shall show hereafter  my acts in morriss time military etcmarg note but i am got forward too fast with my story there are still some transactions to be mentiond that happened during the administration of governor morris war being in a manner commenced with france the government of massachusetts bay projected an attack upon crown point and sent mr quincy to pennsylvania and mr pownall afterward governor pownall to new york to solicit assistance as i was in the assembly knew its temper and was mr quincys countryman he applid to me for my influence and assistance i dictated his address to them which was well receivd they voted an aid of ten thousand pounds to be laid out in provisions but the governor refusing his assent to their bill which included this with other sums granted for the use of the crown unless a clause were inserted exempting the proprietary estate from bearing any part of the tax that would be necessary the assembly tho very desirous of making their grant to new england effectual were at a loss how to accomplish it mr quincy labored hard with the governor to obtain his assent but he was obstinate i then suggested a method of doing the business without the governor by orders on the trustees of the loan office which by law the assembly had the right of drawing there was indeed little or no money at that time in the office and therefore i proposd that the orders should be payable in a year and to bear an interest of five per cent with these orders i supposd the provisions might easily be purchasd the assembly with very little hesitation adopted the proposal the orders were immediately printed and i was one of the committee directed to sign and dispose of them the fund for paying them was the interest of all the paper currency then extant in the province upon loan together with the revenue arising from the excise which being known to be more than sufficient they obtaind instant credit and were not only receivd in payment for the provisions but many moneyd people who had cash lying by them vested it in those orders which they found advantageous as they bore interest while upon hand and might on any occasion be used as money so that they were eagerly all bought up and in a few weeks none of them were to be seen thus this important affair was by my means compleated my quincy returnd thanks to the assembly in a handsome memorial went home highly pleasd with the success of his embassy and ever after bore for me the most cordial and affectionate friendship the british government not chusing to permit the union of the colonies as proposd at albany and to trust that union with their defense lest they should thereby grow too military and feel their own strength suspicions and jealousies at this time being entertaind of them sent over general braddock with two regiments of regular english troops for that purpose he landed at alexandria in virginia and thence marchd to frederictown in maryland where he halted for carriages our assembly apprehending from some information that he had conceived violent prejudices against them as averse to the service wishd me to wait upon him not as from them but as postmastergeneral under the guise of proposing to settle with him the mode of conducting with most celerity and certainty the despatches between him and the governors of the several provinces with whom he must necessarily have continual correspondence and of which they proposd to pay the expense my son accompanied me on this journey we found the general at frederictown waiting impatiently for the return of those he had sent thro the back parts of maryland and virginia to collect waggons i stayed with him several days dind with him daily and had full opportunity of removing all his prejudices by the information of what the assembly had before his arrival actually done and were still willing to do to facilitate his operations when i was about to depart the returns of waggons to be obtained were brought in by which it appeard that they amounted only to twentyfive and not all of those were in serviceable condition the general and all the officers were surprisd declard the expedition was then at an end being impossible and exclaimd against the ministers for ignorantly landing them in a country destitute of the means of conveying their stores baggage etc not less than one hundred and fifty waggons being necessary i happened to say i thought it was a pity they had not been landed rather in pennsylvania as in that country almost every farmer had his waggon the general eagerly laid hold of my words and said then you sir who are a man of interest there can probably procure them for us and i beg you will undertake it i askd what terms were to be offerd the owners of the waggons and i was desird to put on paper the terms that appeared to me necessary this i did and they were agreed to and a commission and instructions accordingly prepard immediately what those terms were will appear in the advertisement i publishd as soon as i arrivd at lancaster which being from the great and sudden effect it producd a piece of some curiosity i shall insert it at length as follows advertisement lancaster april   whereas one hundred and fifty waggons with four horses to each waggon and fifteen hundred saddle or pack horses are wanted for the service of his majestys forces now about to rendezvous at wills creek and his excellency general braddock having been pleased to empower me to contract for the hire of the same i hereby give notice that i shall attend for that purpose at lancaster from this day to next wednesday evening and at york from next thursday morning till friday evening where i shall be ready to agree for waggons and teams or single horses on the following terms viz i that there shall be paid for each waggon with four good horses and a driver fifteen shillings per diem and for each able horse with a packsaddle or other saddle and furniture two shillings per diem and for each able horse without a saddle eighteen pence per diem  that the pay commence from the time of their joining the forces at wills creek which must be on or before the th of may ensuing and that a reasonable allowance be paid over and above for the time necessary for their travelling to wills creek and home again after their discharge  each waggon and team and every saddle or pack horse is to be valued by indifferent persons chosen between me and the owner and in case of the loss of any waggon team or other horse in the service the price according to such valuation is to be allowed and paid  seven days pay is to be advanced and paid in hand by me to the owner of each waggon and team or horse at the time of contracting if required and the remainder to be paid by general braddock or by the paymaster of the army at the time of their discharge or from time to time as it shall be demanded  no drivers of waggons or persons taking care of the hired horses are on any account to be called upon to do the duty of soldiers or be otherwise employed than in conducting or taking care of their carriages or horses  all oats indian corn or other forage that waggons or horses bring to the camp more than is necessary for the subsistence of the horses is to be taken for the use of the army and a reasonable price paid for the same notemy son william franklin is empowered to enter into like contracts with any person in cumberland county b franklin to the inhabitants of the counties of lancaster york and cumberland friends and countrymen being occasionally at the camp at frederic a few days since i found the general and officers extremely exasperated on account of their not being supplied with horses and carriages which had been expected from this province as most able to furnish them but through the dissensions between our governor and assembly money had not been provided nor any steps taken for that purpose it was proposed to send an armed force immediately into these counties to seize as many of the best carriages and horses as should be wanted and compel as many persons into the service as would be necessary to drive and take care of them i apprehended that the progress of british soldiers through these counties on such an occasion especially considering the temper they are in and their resentment against us would be attended with many and great inconveniences to the inhabitants and therefore more willingly took the trouble of trying first what might be done by fair and equitable means the people of these back counties have lately complained to the assembly that a sufficient currency was wanting you have an opportunity of receiving and dividing among you a very considerable sum for if the service of this expedition should continue as it is more than probable it will for one hundred and twenty days the hire of these waggons and horses will amount to upward of thirty thousand pounds which will be paid you in silver and gold of the kings money the service will be light and easy for the army will scarce march above twelve miles per day and the waggons and baggagehorses as they carry those things that are absolutely necessary to the welfare of the army must march with the army and no faster and are for the armys sake always placed where they can be most secure whether in a march or in a camp if you are really as i believe you are good and loyal subjects to his majesty you may now do a most acceptable service and make it easy to yourselves for three or four of such as can not separately spare from the business of their plantations a waggon and four horses and a driver may do it together one furnishing the waggon another one or two horses and another the driver and divide the pay proportionately between you but if you do not this service to your king and country voluntarily when such good pay and reasonable terms are offered to you your loyalty will be strongly suspected the kings business must be done so many brave troops come so far for your defense must not stand idle through your backwardness to do what may be reasonably expected from you waggons and horses must be had violent measures will probably be used and you will be left to seek for a recompense where you can find it and your case perhaps be little pitied or regarded i have no particular interest in this affair as except the satisfaction of endeavoring to do good i shall have only my labour for my pains if this method of obtaining the waggons and horses is not likely to succeed i am obliged to send word to the general in fourteen days and i suppose sir john st clair the hussar with a body of soldiers will immediately enter the province for the purpose which i shall be sorry to hear because i am very sincerely and truly your friend and wellwisher b franklin i received of the general about eight hundred pounds to be disbursed in advancemoney to the waggon owners etc but that sum being insufficient i advancd upward of two hundred pounds more and in two weeks the one hundred and fifty waggons with two hundred and fiftynine carrying horses were on their march for the camp the advertisement promised payment according to the valuation in case any waggon or horse should be lost the owners however alleging they did not know general braddock or what dependence might be had on his promise insisted on my bond for the performance which i accordingly gave them while i was at the camp supping one evening with the officers of colonel dunbars regiment he represented to me his concern for the subalterns who he said were generally not in affluence and could ill afford in this dear country to lay in the stores that might be necessary in so long a march thro a wilderness where nothing was to be purchasd i commiserated their case and resolved to endeavor procuring them some relief i said nothing however to him of my intention but wrote the next morning to the committee of the assembly who had the disposition of some public money warmly recommending the case of these officers to their consideration and proposing that a present should be sent them of necessaries and refreshments my son who had some experience of a camp life and of its wants drew up a list for me which i enclosd in my letter the committee approvd and used such diligence that conducted by my son the stores arrived at the camp as soon as the waggons they consisted of twenty parcels each containing these twenty parcels well packd were placed on as many horses each parcel with the horse being intended as a present for one officer they were very thankfully receivd and the kindness acknowledgd by letters to me from the colonels of both regiments in the most grateful terms the general too was highly satisfied with my conduct in procuring him the waggons etc and readily paid my account of disbursements thanking me repeatedly and requesting my farther assistance in sending provisions after him i undertook this also and was busily employd in it till we heard of his defeat advancing for the service of my own money upwards of one thousand pounds sterling of which i sent him an account it came to his hands luckily for me a few days before the battle and he returnd me immediately an order on the paymaster for the round sum of one thousand pounds leaving the remainder to the next account i consider this payment as good luck having never been able to obtain that remainder of which more hereafter this general was i think a brave man and might probably have made a figure as a good officer in some european war but he had too much selfconfidence too high an opinion of the validity of regular troops and too mean a one of both americans and indians george croghan our indian interpreter joind him on his march with one hundred of those people who might have been of great use to his army as guides scouts etc if he had treated them kindly but he slighted and neglected them and they gradually left him in conversation with him one day he was giving me some account of his intended progress after taking fort duquesne says he i am to proceed to niagara and having taken that to frontenac if the season will allow time and i suppose it will for duquesne can hardly detain me above three or four days and then i see nothing that can obstruct my march to niagara having before revolvd in my mind the long line his army must make in their march by a very narrow road to be cut for them thro the woods and bushes and also what i had read of a former defeat of fifteen hundred french who invaded the iroquois country i had conceivd some doubts and some fears for the event of the campaign but i venturd only to say to be sure sir if you arrive well before duquesne with these fine troops so well provided with artillery that place not yet compleatly fortified and as we hear with no very strong garrison can probably make but a short resistance the only danger i apprehend of obstruction to your march is from ambuscades of indians who by constant practice are dexterous in laying and executing them and the slender line near four miles long which your army must make may expose it to be attackd by surprise in its flanks and to be cut like a thread into several pieces which from their distance can not come up in time to support each other he smild at my ignorance and replyd these savages may indeed be a formidable enemy to your raw american militia but upon the kings regular and disciplind troops sir it is impossible they should make any impression i was conscious of an impropriety in my disputing with a military man in matters of his profession and said no more the enemy however did not take the advantage of his army which i apprehended its long line of march exposd it to but let it advance without interruption till within nine miles of the place and then when more in a body for it had just passed a river where the front had halted till all were come over and in a more open part of the woods than any it had passd attackd its advanced guard by a heavy fire from behind trees and bushes which was the first intelligence the general had of an enemys being near him this guard being disordered the general hurried the troops up to their assistance which was done in great confusion thro waggons baggage and cattle and presently the fire came upon their flank the officers being on horseback were more easily distinguishd pickd out as marks and fell very fast and the soldiers were crowded together in a huddle having or hearing no orders and standing to be shot at till twothirds of them were killed and then being seizd with a panick the whole fled with precipitation the waggoners took each a horse out of his team and scamperd their example was immediately followed by others so that all the waggons provisions artillery and stores were left to the enemy the general being wounded was brought off with difficulty his secretary mr shirley was killed by his side and out of eightysix officers sixtythree were killed or wounded and seven hundred and fourteen men killed out of eleven hundred these eleven hundred had been picked men from the whole army the rest had been left behind with colonel dunbar who was to follow with the heavier part of the stores provisions and baggage the flyers not being pursud arrivd at dunbars camp and the panick they brought with them instantly seizd him and all his people and tho he had now above one thousand men and the enemy who had beaten braddock did not at most exceed four hundred indians and french together instead of proceeding and endeavoring to recover some of the lost honour he ordered all the stores ammunition etc to be destroyd that he might have more horses to assist his flight towards the settlements and less lumber to remove he was there met with requests from the governors of virginia maryland and pennsylvania that he would post his troops on the frontiers so as to afford some protection to the inhabitants but he continud his hasty march thro all the country not thinking himself safe till he arrivd at philadelphia where the inhabitants could protect him this whole transaction gave us americans the first suspicion that our exalted ideas of the prowess of british regulars had not been well founded in their first march too from their landing till they got beyond the settlements they had plundered and stripped the inhabitants totally ruining some poor families besides insulting abusing and confining the people if they remonstrated this was enough to put us out of conceit of such defenders if we had really wanted any how different was the conduct of our french friends in  who during a march thro the most inhabited part of our country from rhode island to virginia near seven hundred miles occasioned not the smallest complaint for the loss of a pig a chicken or even an apple captain orme who was one of the generals aidsdecamp and being grievously wounded was brought off with him and continud with him to his death which happend in a few days told me that he was totally silent all the first day and at night only said who would have thought it that he was silent again the following day saying only at last we shall better know how to deal with them another time and dyd in a few minutes after the secretarys papers with all the generals orders instructions and correspondence falling into the enemys hands they selected and translated into french a number of the articles which they printed to prove the hostile intentions of the british court before the declaration of war among these i saw some letters of the general to the ministry speaking highly of the great service i had rendered the army and recommending me to their notice david hume too who was some years after secretary to lord hertford when minister in france and afterward to general conway when secretary of state told me he had seen among the papers in that office letters from braddock highly recommending me but the expedition having been unfortunate my service it seems was not thought of much value for those recommendations were never of any use to me as to rewards from himself i askd only one which was that he would give orders to his officers not to enlist any more of our bought servants and that he would discharge such as had been already enlisted this he readily granted and several were accordingly returnd to their masters on my application dunbar when the command devolvd on him was not so generous he being at philadelphia on his retreat or rather flight i applyd to him for the discharge of the servants of three poor farmers of lancaster county that he had enlisted reminding him of the late generals orders on that head he promised me that if the masters would come to him at trenton where he should be in a few days on his march to new york he would there deliver their men to them they accordingly were at the expense and trouble of going to trenton and there he refusd to perform his promise to their great loss and disappointment as soon as the loss of the waggons and horses was generally known all the owners came upon me for the valuation which i had given bond to pay their demands gave me a great deal of trouble my acquainting them that the money was ready in the paymasters hands but that orders for paying it must first be obtained from general shirley and my assuring them that i had applyd to that general by letter but he being at a distance an answer could not soon be receivd and they must have patience all this was not sufficient to satisfy and some began to sue me general shirley at length relieved me from this terrible situation by appointing commissioners to examine the claims and ordering payment they amounted to near twenty thousand pound which to pay would have ruined me before we had the news of this defeat the two doctors bond came to me with a subscription paper for raising money to defray the expense of a grand firework which it was intended to exhibit at a rejoicing on receipt of the news of our taking fort duquesne i looked grave and said it would i thought be time enough to prepare for the rejoicing when we knew we should have occasion to rejoice they seemd surprisd that i did not immediately comply with their proposal why the dl says one of them you surely dont suppose that the fort will not be taken i dont know that it will not be taken but i know that the events of war are subject to great uncertainty i gave them the reasons of my doubting the subscription was dropt and the projectors thereby missed the mortification they would have undergone if the firework had been prepared dr bond on some other occasion afterward said that he did not like franklins forebodings governor morris who had continually worried the assembly with message after message before the defeat of braddock to beat them into the making of acts to raise money for the defense of the province without taxing among others the proprietary estates and had rejected all their bills for not having such an exempting clause now redoubled his attacks with more hope of success the danger and necessity being greater the assembly however continud firm believing they had justice on their side and that it would be giving up an essential right if they suffered the governor to amend their moneybills in one of the last indeed which was for granting fifty thousand pounds his proposd amendment was only of a single word the bill expressed that all estates real and personal were to be taxed those of the proprietaries not excepted his amendment was for not read only a small but very material alteration however when the news of this disaster reached england our friends there whom we had taken care to furnish with all the assemblys answers to the governors messages raisd a clamor against the proprietaries for their meanness and injustice in giving their governor such instructions some going so far as to say that by obstructing the defense of their province they forfeited their right to it they were intimidated by this and sent orders to their receivergeneral to add five thousand pounds of their money to whatever sum might be given by the assembly for such purpose this being notified to the house was accepted in lieu of their share of a general tax and a new bill was formd with an exempting clause which passed accordingly by this act i was appointed one of the commissioners for disposing of the money sixty thousand pounds i had been active in modelling the bill and procuring its passage and had at the same time drawn a bill for establishing and disciplining of a voluntary militia which i carried thro the house without much difficulty as care was taken in it to leave the quakers at their liberty to promote the association necessary to form the militia i wrote a dialogue stating and answering all the objections i could think of to such a militia which was printed and had as i thought great effect  this dialogue and the militia act are in the gentlemans magazine for february and march  marg note while the several companies in the city and country were forming and learning their exercise the governor prevaild with me to take charge of our northwestern frontier which was infested by the enemy and provide for the defense of the inhabitants by raising troops and building a line of forts i undertook this military business tho i did not conceive myself well qualified for it he gave me a commission with full powers and a parcel of blank commissions for officers to be given to whom i thought fit i had but little difficulty in raising men having soon five hundred and sixty under my command my son who had in the preceding war been an officer in the army raisd against canada was my aiddecamp and of great use to me the indians had burned gnadenhut a village settled by the moravians and massacred the inhabitants but the place was thought a good situation for one of the forts in order to march thither i assembled the companies at bethlehem the chief establishment of those people i was surprised to find it in so good a posture of defense the destruction of gnadenhut had made them apprehend danger the principal buildings were defended by a stockade they had purchased a quantity of arms and ammunition from new york and had even placd quantities of small paving stones between the windows of their high stone houses for their women to throw down upon the heads of any indians that should attempt to force into them the armed brethren too kept watch and relievd as methodically as in any garrison town in conversation with the bishop spangenberg i mentiond this my surprise for knowing they had obtained an act of parliament exempting them from military duties in the colonies i had supposd they were conscientiously scrupulous of bearing arms he answerd me that it was not one of their established principles but that at the time of their obtaining that act it was thought to be a principle with many of their people on this occasion however they to their surprise found it adopted by but a few it seems they were either deceivd in themselves or deceivd the parliament but common sense aided by present danger will sometimes be too strong for whimsical opinions it was the beginning of january when we set out upon this business of building forts i sent one detachment toward the minisink with instructions to erect one for the security of that upper part of the country and another to the lower part with similar instructions and i concluded to go myself with the rest of my force to gnadenhut where a fort was thot more immediately necessary the moravians procurd me five waggons for our tools stores baggage etc just before we left bethlehem eleven farmers who had been driven from their plantations by the indians came to me requesting a supply of firearms that they might go back and fetch off their cattle i gave them each a gun with suitable ammunition we had not marchd many miles before it began to rain and it continued raining all day there were no habitations on the road to shelter us till we arrivd near night at the house of a german where and in his barn we were all huddled together as wet as water could make us it was well we were not attackd in our march for our arms were of the most ordinary sort and our men could not keep their gun locks dry the indians are dextrous in contrivances for that purpose which we had not they met that day the eleven poor farmers above mentioned and killed ten of them the one who escapd informd that his and his companions guns would not go off the priming being wet with the rain the next day being fair we continud our march and arrivd at the desolated gnadenhut there was a sawmill near round which were left several piles of boards with which we soon hutted ourselves an operation the more necessary at that inclement season as we had no tents our first work was to bury more effectually the dead we found there who had been half interrd by the country people the next morning our fort was plannd and markd out the circumference measuring four hundred and fiftyfive feet which would require as many palisades to be made of trees one with another of a foot diameter each our axes of which we had seventy were immediately set to work to cut down trees and our men being dextrous in the use of them great despatch was made seeing the trees fall so fast i had the curiosity to look at my watch when two men began to cut at a pine in six minutes they had it upon the ground and i found it of fourteen inches diameter each pine made three palisades of eighteen feet long pointed at one end while these were preparing our other men dug a trench all round of three feet deep in which the palisades were to be planted and our waggons the bodys being taken off and the fore and hind wheels separated by taking out the pin which united the two parts of the perch we had ten carriages with two horses each to bring the palisades from the woods to the spot when they were set up our carpenters built a stage of boards all round within about six feet high for the men to stand on when to fire thro the loopholes we had one swivel gun which we mounted on one of the angles and fird it as soon as fixd to let the indians know if any were within hearing that we had such pieces and thus our fort if such a magnificent name may be given to so miserable a stockade was finishd in a week though it raind so hard every other day that the men could not work this gave me occasion to observe that when men are employd they are best contentd for on the days they worked they were goodnaturd and cheerful and with the consciousness of having done a good days work they spent the evening jollily but on our idle days they were mutinous and quarrelsome finding fault with their pork the bread etc and in continual illhumor which put me in mind of a seacaptain whose rule it was to keep his men constantly at work and when his mate once told him that they had done every thing and there was nothing further to employ them about oh says he make them scour the anchor this kind of fort however contemptible is a sufficient defense against indians who have no cannon finding ourselves now posted securely and having a place to retreat to on occasion we venturd out in parties to scour the adjacent country we met with no indians but we found the places on the neighboring hills where they had lain to watch our proceedings there was an art in their contrivance of those places that seems worth mention it being winter a fire was necessary for them but a common fire on the surface of the ground would by its light have discovered their position at a distance they had therefore dug holes in the ground about three feet diameter and somewhat deeper we saw where they had with their hatchets cut off the charcoal from the sides of burnt logs lying in the woods with these coals they had made small fires in the bottom of the holes and we observd among the weeds and grass the prints of their bodies made by their laying all round with their legs hanging down in the holes to keep their feet warm which with them is an essential point this kind of fire so managd could not discover them either by its light flame sparks or even smoke it appeard that their number was not great and it seems they saw we were too many to be attacked by them with prospect of advantage we had for our chaplain a zealous presbyterian minister mr beatty who complained to me that the men did not generally attend his prayers and exhortations when they enlisted they were promised besides pay and provisions a gill of rum a day which was punctually servd out to them half in the morning and the other half in the evening and i observd they were as punctual in attending to receive it upon which i said to mr beatty it is perhaps below the dignity of your profession to act as steward of the rum but if you were to deal it out and only just after prayers you would have them all about you he liked the thot undertook the office and with the help of a few hands to measure out the liquor executed it to satisfaction and never were prayers more generally and more punctually attended so that i thought this method preferable to the punishment inflicted by some military laws for nonattendance on divine service i had hardly finishd this business and got my fort well stord with provisions when i receivd a letter from the governor acquainting me that he had calld the assembly and wished my attendance there if the posture of affairs on the frontiers was such that my remaining there was no longer necessary my friends too of the assembly pressing me by their letters to be if possible at the meeting and my three intended forts being now compleated and the inhabitants contented to remain on their farms under that protection i resolved to return the more willingly as a new england officer colonel clapham experienced in indian war being on a visit to our establishment consented to accept the command i gave him a commission and parading the garrison had it read before them and introducd him to them as an officer who from his skill in military affairs was much more fit to command them than myself and giving them a little exhortation took my leave i was escorted as far as bethlehem where i rested a few days to recover from the fatigue i had undergone the first night being in a good bed i could hardly sleep it was so different from my hard lodging on the floor of our hut at gnaden wrapt only in a blanket or two while at bethlehem i inquird a little into the practice of the moravians some of them had accompanied me and all were very kind to me i found they workd for a common stock eat at common tables and slept in common dormitories great numbers together in the dormitories i observed loopholes at certain distances all along just under the ceiling which i thought judiciously placed for change of air i was at their church where i was entertaind with good musick the organ being accompanied with violins hautboys flutes clarinets etc i understood that their sermons were not usually preached to mixed congregations of men women and children as is our common practice but that they assembled sometimes the married men at other times their wives then the young men the young women and the little children each division by itself the sermon i heard was to the latter who came in and were placd in rows on benches the boys under the conduct of a young man their tutor and the girls conducted by a young woman the discourse seemd well adapted to their capacities and was deliverd in a pleasing familiar manner coaxing them as it were to be good they behavd very orderly but looked pale and unhealthy which made me suspect they were kept too much within doors or not allowd sufficient exercise i inquird concerning the moravian marriages whether the report was true that they were by lot i was told that lots were usd only in particular cases that generally when a young man found himself disposd to marry he informd the elders of his class who consulted the elder ladies that governd the young women as these elders of the different sexes were well acquainted with the tempers and dispositions of their respective pupils they could best judge what matches were suitable and their judgments were generally acquiescd in but if for example it should happen that two or three young women were found to be equally proper for the young man the lot was then recurred to i objected if the matches are not made by the mutual choice of the parties some of them may chance to be very unhappy and so they may answerd my informer if you let the parties chuse for themselves which indeed i could not deny being returned to philadelphia i found the association went on swimmingly the inhabitants that were not quakers having pretty generally come into it formed themselves into companies and chose their captains lieutenants and ensigns according to the new law dr b visited me and gave me an account of the pains he had taken to spread a general good liking to the law and ascribed much to those endeavors i had had the vanity to ascribe all to my dialogue however not knowing but that he might be in the right i let him enjoy his opinion which i take to be generally the best way in such cases the officers meeting chose me to be colonel of the regiment which i this time accepted i forget how many companies we had but we paraded about twelve hundred welllooking men with a company of artillery who had been furnished with six brass fieldpieces which they had become so expert in the use of as to fire twelve times in a minute the first time i reviewed my regiment they accompanied me to my house and would salute me with some rounds fired before my door which shook down and broke several glasses of my electrical apparatus and my new honour proved not much less brittle for all our commissions were soon after broken by a repeal of the law in england during this short time of my colonelship being about to set out on a journey to virginia the officers of my regiment took it into their heads that it would be proper for them to escort me out of town as far as the lower ferry just as i was getting on horseback they came to my door between thirty and forty mounted and all in their uniforms i had not been previously acquainted with the project or i should have prevented it being naturally averse to the assuming of state on any occasion and i was a good deal chagrind at their appearance as i could not avoid their accompanying me what made it worse was that as soon as we began to move they drew their swords and rode with them naked all the way somebody wrote an account of this to the proprietor and it gave him great offense no such honor had been paid him when in the province nor to any of his governors and he said it was only proper to princes of the blood royal which may be true for aught i know who was and still am ignorant of the etiquette in such cases this silly affair however greatly increased his rancour against me which was before not a little on account of my conduct in the assembly respecting the exemption of his estate from taxation which i had always opposd very warmly and not without severe reflections on his meanness and injustice of contending for it he accused me to the ministry as being the great obstacle to the kings service preventing by my influence in the house the proper form of the bills for raising money and he instanced this parade with my officers as a proof of my having an intention to take the government of the province out of his hands by force he also applied to sir everard fawkener the postmastergeneral to deprive me of my office but it had no other effect than to procure from sir everard a gentle admonition notwithstanding the continual wrangle between the governor and the house in which i as a member had so large a share there still subsisted a civil intercourse between that gentleman and myself and we never had any personal difference i have sometimes since thought that his little or no resentment against me for the answers it was known i drew up to his messages might be the effect of professional habit and that being bred a lawyer he might consider us both as merely advocates for contending clients in a suit he for the proprietaries and i for the assembly he would therefore sometimes call in a friendly way to advise with me on difficult points and sometimes tho not often take my advice we acted in concert to supply braddocks army with provisions and when the shocking news arrived of his defeat the governor sent in haste for me to consult with him on measures for preventing the desertion of the back counties i forget now the advice i gave but i think it was that dunbar should be written to and prevaild with if possible to post his troops on the frontiers for their protection till by reenforcements from the colonies he might be able to proceed on the expedition and after my return from the frontier he would have had me undertake the conduct of such an expedition with provincial troops for the reduction of fort duquesne dunbar and his men being otherwise employed and he proposed to commission me as general i had not so good an opinion of my military abilities as he professd to have and i believe his professions must have exceeded his real sentiments but probably he might think that my popularity would facilitate the raising of the men and my influence in assembly the grant of money to pay them and that perhaps without taxing the proprietary estate finding me not so forward to engage as he expected the project was dropt and he soon after left the government being superseded by captain denny before i proceed in relating the part i had in public affairs under this new governors administration it may not be amiss here to give some account of the rise and progress of my philosophical reputation in  being at boston i met there with a dr spence who was lately arrived from scotland and showd me some electric experiments they were imperfectly performd as he was not very expert but being on a subject quite new to me they equally surprisd and pleased me soon after my return to philadelphia our library company receivd from mr p collinson fellow of the royal society of london a present of a glass tube with some account of the use of it in making such experiments i eagerly seized the opportunity of repeating what i had seen at boston and by much practice acquird great readiness in performing those also which we had an account of from england adding a number of new ones i say much practice for my house was continually full for some time with people who came to see these new wonders to divide a little this incumbrance among my friends i caused a number of similar tubes to be blown at our glasshouse with which they furnishd themselves so that we had at length several performers among these the principal was mr kinnersley an ingenious neighbor who being out of business i encouraged to undertake showing the experiments for money and drew up for him two lectures in which the experiments were rangd in such order and accompanied with such explanations in such method as that the foregoing should assist in comprehending the following he procurd an elegant apparatus for the purpose in which all the little machines that i had roughly made for myself were nicely formd by instrumentmakers his lectures were well attended and gave great satisfaction and after some time he went thro the colonies exhibiting them in every capital town and pickd up some money in the west india islands indeed it was with difficulty the experiments could be made from the general moisture of the air obligd as we were to mr collinson for his present of the tube etc i thought it right he should be informd of our success in using it and wrote him several letters containing accounts of our experiments he got them read in the royal society where they were not at first thought worth so much notice as to be printed in their transactions one paper which i wrote for mr kinnersley on the sameness of lightning with electricity i sent to dr mitchel an acquaintance of mine and one of the members also of that society who wrote me word that it had been read but was laughed at by the connoisseurs the papers however being shown to dr fothergill he thought them of too much value to be stifled and advisd the printing of them mr collinson then gave them to cave for publication in his gentlemans magazine but he chose to print them separately in a pamphlet and dr fothergill wrote the preface cave it seems judged rightly for his profit for by the additions that arrived afterward they swelld to a quarto volume which has had five editions and cost him nothing for copymoney it was however some time before those papers were much taken notice of in england a copy of them happening to fall into the hands of the count de buffon a philosopher deservedly of great reputation in france and indeed all over europe he prevailed with m dalibard to translate them into french and they were printed at paris the publication offended the abbe nollet preceptor in natural philosophy to the royal family and an able experimenter who had formd and publishd a theory of electricity which then had the general vogue he could not at first believe that such a work came from america and said it must have been fabricated by his enemies at paris to decry his system afterwards having been assurd that there really existed such a person as franklin at philadelphia which he had doubted he wrote and published a volume of letters chiefly addressd to me defending his theory and denying the verity of my experiments and of the positions deducd from them i once purposd answering the abbe and actually began the answer but on consideration that my writings containd a description of experiments which any one might repeat and verify and if not to be verifid could not be defended or of observations offerd as conjectures and not delivered dogmatically therefore not laying me under any obligation to defend them and reflecting that a dispute between two persons writing in different languages might be lengthened greatly by mistranslations and thence misconceptions of one anothers meaning much of one of the abbes letters being founded on an error in the translation i concluded to let my papers shift for themselves believing it was better to spend what time i could spare from public business in making new experiments than in disputing about those already made i therefore never answered m nollet and the event gave me no cause to repent my silence for my friend m le roy of the royal academy of sciences took up my cause and refuted him my book was translated into the italian german and latin languages and the doctrine it containd was by degrees universally adopted by the philosophers of europe in preference to that of the abbe so that he lived to see himself the last of his sect except monsieur b of paris his eleve and immediate disciple what gave my book the more sudden and general celebrity was the success of one of its proposed experiments made by messrs dalibard and de lor at marly for drawing lightning from the clouds this engagd the public attention every where m de lor who had an apparatus for experimental philosophy and lecturd in that branch of science undertook to repeat what he called the philadelphia experiments and after they were performed before the king and court all the curious of paris flocked to see them i will not swell this narrative with an account of that capital experiment nor of the infinite pleasure i receivd in the success of a similar one i made soon after with a kite at philadelphia as both are to be found in the histories of electricity dr wright an english physician when at paris wrote to a friend who was of the royal society an account of the high esteem my experiments were in among the learned abroad and of their wonder that my writings had been so little noticed in england the society on this resumd the consideration of the letters that had been read to them and the celebrated dr watson drew up a summary account of them and of all i had afterwards sent to england on the subject which he accompanied with some praise of the writer this summary was then printed in their transactions and some members of the society in london particularly the very ingenious mr canton having verified the experiment of procuring lightning from the clouds by a pointed rod and acquainting them with the success they soon made me more than amends for the slight with which they had before treated me without my having made any application for that honor they chose me a member and voted that i should be excusd the customary payments which would have amounted to twentyfive guineas and ever since have given me their transactions gratis they also presented me with the gold medal of sir godfrey copley for the year  the delivery of which was accompanied by a very handsome speech of the president lord macclesfield wherein i was highly honoured our new governor captain denny brought over for me the beforementioned medal from the royal society which he presented to me at an entertainment given him by the city he accompanied it with very polite expressions of his esteem for me having as he said been long acquainted with my character after dinner when the company as was customary at that time were engagd in drinking he took me aside into another room and acquainted me that he had been advisd by his friends in england to cultivate a friendship with me as one who was capable of giving him the best advice and of contributing most effectually to the making his administration easy that he therefore desired of all things to have a good understanding with me and he beggd me to be assurd of his readiness on all occasions to render me every service that might be in his power he said much to me also of the proprietors good disposition towards the province and of the advantage it might be to us all and to me in particular if the opposition that had been so long continud to his measures was dropt and harmony restord between him and the people in effecting which it was thought no one could be more serviceable than myself and i might depend on adequate acknowledgments and recompenses etc etc the drinkers finding we did not return immediately to the table sent us a decanter of madeira which the governor made liberal use of and in proportion became more profuse of his solicitations and promises my answers were to this purpose that my circumstances thanks to god were such as to make proprietary favours unnecessary to me and that being a member of the assembly i could not possibly accept of any that however i had no personal enmity to the proprietary and that whenever the public measures he proposd should appear to be for the good of the people no one should espouse and forward them more zealously than myself my past opposition having been founded on this that the measures which had been urged were evidently intended to serve the proprietary interest with great prejudice to that of the people that i was much obliged to him the governor for his professions of regard to me and that he might rely on every thing in my power to make his administration as easy as possible hoping at the same time that he had not brought with him the same unfortunate instruction his predecessor had been hamperd with on this he did not then explain himself but when he afterwards came to do business with the assembly they appeard again the disputes were renewed and i was as active as ever in the opposition being the penman first of the request to have a communication of the instructions and then of the remarks upon them which may be found in the votes of the time and in the historical review i afterward publishd but between us personally no enmity arose we were often together he was a man of letters had seen much of the world and was very entertaining and pleasing in conversation he gave me the first information that my old friend jas ralph was still alive that he was esteemd one of the best political writers in england had been employd in the dispute between prince frederic and the king and had obtaind a pension of three hundred a year that his reputation was indeed small as a poet pope having damned his poetry in the dunciad but his prose was thought as good as any mans the assembly finally finding the proprietary obstinately persisted in manacling their deputies with instructions inconsistent not only with the privileges of the people but with the service of the crown resolvd to petition the king against them and appointed me their agent to go over to england to present and support the petition the house had sent up a bill to the governor granting a sum of sixty thousand pounds for the kings use ten thousand pounds of which was subjected to the orders of the then general lord loudoun which the governor absolutely refusd to pass in compliance with his instructions  the many unanimous resolves of the assembly what datemarg note i had agreed with captain morris of the paquet at new york for my passage and my stores were put on board when lord loudoun arrivd at philadelphia expressly as he told me to endeavor an accommodation between the governor and assembly that his majestys service might not be obstructed by their dissensions accordingly he desird the governor and myself to meet him that he might hear what was to be said on both sides we met and discussd the business in behalf of the assembly i urgd all the various arguments that may be found in the public papers of that time which were of my writing and are printed with the minutes of the assembly and the governor pleaded his instructions the bond he had given to observe them and his ruin if he disobeyd yet seemed not unwilling to hazard himself if lord loudoun would advise it this his lordship did not chuse to do though i once thought i had nearly prevaild with him to do it but finally he rather chose to urge the compliance of the assembly and he entreated me to use my endeavours with them for that purpose declaring that he would spare none of the kings troops for the defense of our frontiers and that if we did not continue to provide for that defense ourselves they must remain exposd to the enemy i acquainted the house with what had passd and presenting them with a set of resolutions i had drawn up declaring our rights and that we did not relinquish our claim to those rights but only suspended the exercise of them on this occasion thro force against which we protested they at length agreed to drop that bill and frame another conformable to the proprietary instructions this of course the governor passd and i was then at liberty to proceed on my voyage but in the meantime the paquet had sailed with my seastores which was some loss to me and my only recompense was his lordships thanks for my service all the credit of obtaining the accommodation falling to his share he set out for new york before me and as the time for dispatching the paquetboats was at his disposition and there were two then remaining there one of which he said was to sail very soon i requested to know the precise time that i might not miss her by any delay of mine his answer was i have given out that she is to sail on saturday next but i may let you know entre nous that if you are there by monday morning you will be in time but do not delay longer by some accidental hinderance at a ferry it was monday noon before i arrived and i was much afraid she might have sailed as the wind was fair but i was soon made easy by the information that she was still in the harbor and would not move till the next day one would imagine that i was now on the very point of departing for europe i thought so but i was not then so well acquainted with his lordships character of which indecision was one of the strongest features i shall give some instances it was about the beginning of april that i came to new york and i think it was near the end of june before we saild there were then two of the paquetboats which had been long in port but were detained for the generals letters which were always to be ready tomorrow another paquet arrivd she too was detaind and before we saild a fourth was expected ours was the first to be dispatchd as having been there longest passengers were engagd in all and some extremely impatient to be gone and the merchants uneasy about their letters and the orders they had given for insurance it being war time for fall goods but their anxiety availd nothing his lordships letters were not ready and yet whoever waited on him found him always at his desk pen in hand and concluded he must needs write abundantly going myself one morning to pay my respects i found in his antechamber one innis a messenger of philadelphia who had come from thence express with a paquet from governor denny for the general he delivered to me some letters from my friends there which occasiond my inquiring when he was to return and where be lodgd that i might send some letters by him he told me he was orderd to call tomorrow at nine for the generals answer to the governor and should set off immediately i put my letters into his hands the same day a fortnight after i met him again in the same place so you are soon returnd innis returned no i am not gone yet how so i have called here by order every morning these two weeks past for his lordships letter and it is not yet ready is it possible when he is so great a writer for i see him constantly at his escritoire yes says innis but he is like st george on the signs always on horseback and never rides on this observation of the messenger was it seems well founded for when in england i understood that mr pitt gave it as one reason for removing this general and sending generals amherst and wolfe that the minister never heard from him and could not know what he was doing this daily expectation of sailing and all the three paquets going down to sandy hook to join the fleet there the passengers thought it best to be on board lest by a sudden order the ships should sail and they be left behind there if i remember right we were about six weeks consuming our seastores and obligd to procure more at length the fleet saild the general and all his army on board bound to louisburg with intent to besiege and take that fortress all the paquetboats in company ordered to attend the generals ship ready to receive his dispatches when they should be ready we were out five days before we got a letter with leave to part and then our ship quitted the fleet and steered for england the other two paquets he still detained carried them with him to halifax where he stayed some time to exercise the men in sham attacks upon sham forts then alterd his mind as to besieging louisburg and returnd to new york with all his troops together with the two paquets above mentioned and all their passengers during his absence the french and savages had taken fort george on the frontier of that province and the savages had massacred many of the garrison after capitulation i saw afterwards in london captain bonnell who commanded one of those paquets he told me that when he had been detaind a month he acquainted his lordship that his ship was grown foul to a degree that must necessarily hinder her fast sailing a point of consequence for a paquetboat and requested an allowance of time to heave her down and clean her bottom he was asked how long time that would require he answerd three days the general replied if you can do it in one day i give leave otherwise not for you must certainly sail the day after tomorrow so he never obtaind leave though detained afterwards from day to day during full three months i saw also in london one of bonnells passengers who was so enragd against his lordship for deceiving and detaining him so long at new york and then carrying him to halifax and back again that he swore he would sue for damages whether he did or not i never heard but as he represented the injury to his affairs it was very considerable on the whole i wonderd much how such a man came to be intrusted with so important a business as the conduct of a great army but having since seen more of the great world and the means of obtaining and motives for giving places my wonder is diminished general shirley on whom the command of the army devolved upon the death of braddock would in my opinion if continued in place have made a much better campaign than that of loudoun in  which was frivolous expensive and disgraceful to our nation beyond conception for tho shirley was not a bred soldier he was sensible and sagacious in himself and attentive to good advice from others capable of forming judicious plans and quick and active in carrying them into execution loudoun instead of defending the colonies with his great army left them totally exposd while he paraded idly at halifax by which means fort george was lost besides he derangd all our mercantile operations and distressd our trade by a long embargo on the exportation of provisions on pretence of keeping supplies from being obtaind by the enemy but in reality for beating down their price in favor of the contractors in whose profits it was said perhaps from suspicion only he had a share and when at length the embargo was taken off by neglecting to send notice of it to charlestown the carolina fleet was detaind near three months longer whereby their bottoms were so much damaged by the worm that a great part of them foundered in their passage home shirley was i believe sincerely glad of being relieved from so burdensome a charge as the conduct of an army must be to a man unacquainted with military business i was at the entertainment given by the city of new york to lord loudoun on his taking upon him the command shirley tho thereby superseded was present also there was a great company of officers citizens and strangers and some chairs having been borrowed in the neighborhood there was one among them very low which fell to the lot of mr shirley perceiving it as i sat by him i said they have given you sir too low a seat no matter says he mr franklin i find a low seat the easiest while i was as afore mentiond detaind at new york i receivd all the accounts of the provisions etc that i had furnishd to braddock some of which accounts could not sooner be obtaind from the different persons i had employd to assist in the business i presented them to lord loudoun desiring to be paid the ballance he causd them to be regularly examined by the proper officer who after comparing every article with its voucher certified them to be right and the balance due for which his lordship promisd to give me an order on the paymaster this was however put off from time to time and tho i calld often for it by appointment i did not get it at length just before my departure he told me he had on better consideration concluded not to mix his accounts with those of his predecessors and you says he when in england have only to exhibit your accounts at the treasury and you will be paid immediately i mentiond but without effect the great and unexpected expense i had been put to by being detaind so long at new york as a reason for my desiring to be presently paid and on my observing that it was not right i should be put to any further trouble or delay in obtaining the money i had advancd as i charged no commission for my service o sir says he you must not think of persuading us that you are no gainer we understand better those affairs and know that every one concerned in supplying the army finds means in the doing it to fill his own pockets i assurd him that was not my case and that i had not pocketed a farthing but he appeard clearly not to believe me and indeed i have since learnt that immense fortunes are often made in such employments as to my ballance i am not paid it to this day of which more hereafter our captain of the paquet had boasted much before we sailed of the swiftness of his ship unfortunately when we came to sea she proved the dullest of ninetysix sail to his no small mortification after many conjectures respecting the cause when we were near another ship almost as dull as ours which however gaind upon us the captain ordered all hands to come aft and stand as near the ensign staff as possible we were passengers included about forty persons while we stood there the ship mended her pace and soon left her neighbour far behind which provd clearly what our captain suspected that she was loaded too much by the head the casks of water it seems had been all placd forward these he therefore orderd to be movd further aft on which the ship recoverd her character and proved the sailer in the fleet the captain said she had once gone at the rate of thirteen knots which is accounted thirteen miles per hour we had on board as a passenger captain kennedy of the navy who contended that it was impossible and that no ship ever sailed so fast and that there must have been some error in the division of the logline or some mistake in heaving the log a wager ensud between the two captains to be decided when there should be sufficient wind kennedy thereupon examind rigorously the logline and being satisfid with that he determind to throw the log himself accordingly some days after when the wind blew very fair and fresh and the captain of the paquet lutwidge said he believd she then went at the rate of thirteen knots kennedy made the experiment and ownd his wager lost the above fact i give for the sake of the following observation it has been remarkd as an imperfection in the art of shipbuilding that it can never be known till she is tried whether a new ship will or will not be a good sailer for that the model of a goodsailing ship has been exactly followd in a new one which has provd on the contrary remarkably dull i apprehend that this may partly be occasiond by the different opinions of seamen respecting the modes of lading rigging and sailing of a ship each has his system and the same vessel laden by the judgment and orders of one captain shall sail better or worse than when by the orders of another besides it scarce ever happens that a ship is formd fitted for the sea and saild by the same person one man builds the hull another rigs her a third lades and sails her no one of these has the advantage of knowing all the ideas and experience of the others and therefore can not draw just conclusions from a combination of the whole even in the simple operation of sailing when at sea i have often observd different judgments in the officers who commanded the successive watches the wind being the same one would have the sails trimmd sharper or flatter than another so that they seemd to have no certain rule to govern by yet i think a set of experiments might be instituted first to determine the most proper form of the hull for swift sailing next the best dimensions and properest place for the masts then the form and quantity of sails and their position as the wind may be and lastly the disposition of the lading this is an age of experiments and i think a set accurately made and combind would be of great use i am persuaded therefore that ere long some ingenious philosopher will undertake it to whom i wish success we were several times chasd in our passage but outsaild every thing and in thirty days had soundings we had a good observation and the captain judgd himself so near our port falmouth that if we made a good run in the night we might be off the mouth of that harbor in the morning and by running in the night might escape the notice of the enemys privateers who often crusd near the entrance of the channel accordingly all the sail was set that we could possibly make and the wind being very fresh and fair we went right before it and made great way the captain after his observation shapd his course as he thought so as to pass wide of the scilly isles but it seems there is sometimes a strong indraught setting up st georges channel which deceives seamen and caused the loss of sir cloudesley shovels squadron this indraught was probably the cause of what happened to us we had a watchman placd in the bow to whom they often called look well out before there and he as often answered ay ay but perhaps had his eyes shut and was half asleep at the time they sometimes answering as is said mechanically for he did not see a light just before us which had been hid by the studdingsails from the man at the helm and from the rest of the watch but by an accidental yaw of the ship was discoverd and occasiond a great alarm we being very near it the light appearing to me as big as a cartwheel it was midnight and our captain fast asleep but captain kennedy jumping upon deck and seeing the danger ordered the ship to wear round all sails standing an operation dangerous to the masts but it carried us clear and we escaped shipwreck for we were running right upon the rocks on which the lighthouse was erected this deliverance impressed me strongly with the utility of lighthouses and made me resolve to encourage the building more of them in america if i should live to return there in the morning it was found by the soundings etc that we were near our port but a thick fog hid the land from our sight about nine oclock the fog began to rise and seemd to be lifted up from the water like the curtain at a playhouse discovering underneath the town of falmouth the vessels in its harbor and the fields that surrounded it this was a most pleasing spectacle to those who had been so long without any other prospects than the uniform view of a vacant ocean and it gave us the more pleasure as we were now free from the anxieties which the state of war occasiond i set out immediately with my son for london and we only stopt a little by the way to view stonehenge on salisbury plain and lord pembrokes house and gardens with his very curious antiquities at wilton we arrived in london the th of july   here terminates the autobiography as published by wm temple franklin and his successors what follows was written in the last year of dr franklins life and was first printed in english in mr bigelows edition of ed as soon as i was settled in a lodging mr charles had provided for me i went to visit dr fothergill to whom i was strongly recommended and whose counsel respecting my proceedings i was advisd to obtain he was against an immediate complaint to government and thought the proprietaries should first be personally applid to who might possibly be inducd by the interposition and persuasion of some private friends to accommodate matters amicably i then waited on my old friend and correspondent mr peter collinson who told me that john hanbury the great virginia merchant had requested to be informed when i should arrive that he might carry me to lord granvilles who was then president of the council and wished to see me as soon as possible i agreed to go with him the next morning accordingly mr hanbury called for me and took me in his carriage to that noblemans who receivd me with great civility and after some questions respecting the present state of affairs in america and discourse thereupon he said to me you americans have wrong ideas of the nature of your constitution you contend that the kings instructions to his governors are not laws and think yourselves at liberty to regard or disregard them at your own discretion but those instructions are not like the pocket instructions given to a minister going abroad for regulating his conduct in some trifling point of ceremony they are first drawn up by judges learned in the laws they are then considered debated and perhaps amended in council after which they are signed by the king they are then so far as they relate to you the law of the land for the king is the legislator of the colonies i told his lordship this was new doctrine to me i had always understood from our charters that our laws were to be made by our assemblies to be presented indeed to the king for his royal assent but that being once given the king could not repeal or alter them and as the assemblies could not make permanent laws without his assent so neither could he make a law for them without theirs he assurd me i was totally mistaken i did not think so however and his lordships conversation having a little alarmd me as to what might be the sentiments of the court concerning us i wrote it down as soon as i returnd to my lodgings i recollected that about  years before a clause in a bill brought into parliament by the ministry had proposd to make the kings instructions laws in the colonies but the clause was thrown out by the commons for which we adored them as our friends and friends of liberty till by their conduct towards us in  it seemd that they had refusd that point of sovereignty to the king only that they might reserve it for themselves after some days dr fothergill having spoken to the proprietaries they agreed to a meeting with me at mr t penns house in spring garden the conversation at first consisted of mutual declarations of disposition to reasonable accommodations but i suppose each party had its own ideas of what should be meant by reasonable we then went into consideration of our several points of complaint which i enumerated the proprietaries justifyd their conduct as well as they could and i the assemblys we now appeared very wide and so far from each other in our opinions as to discourage all hope of agreement however it was concluded that i should give them the heads of our complaints in writing and they promisd then to consider them i did so soon after but they put the paper into the hands of their solicitor ferdinand john paris who managed for them all their law business in their great suit with the neighbouring proprietary of maryland lord baltimore which had subsisted  years and wrote for them all their papers and messages in their dispute with the assembly he was a proud angry man and as i had occasionally in the answers of the assembly treated his papers with some severity they being really weak in point of argument and haughty in expression he had conceived a mortal enmity to me which discovering itself whenever we met i declind the proprietarys proposal that he and i should discuss the heads of complaint between our two selves and refusd treating with any one but them they then by his advice put the paper into the hands of the attorney and solicitorgeneral for their opinion and counsel upon it where it lay unanswered a year wanting eight days during which time i made frequent demands of an answer from the proprietaries but without obtaining any other than that they had not yet received the opinion of the attorney and solicitorgeneral what it was when they did receive it i never learnt for they did not communicate it to me but sent a long message to the assembly drawn and signed by paris reciting my paper complaining of its want of formality as a rudeness on my part and giving a flimsy justification of their conduct adding that they should be willing to accommodate matters if the assembly would send out some person of candour to treat with them for that purpose intimating thereby that i was not such the want of formality or rudeness was probably my not having addressd the paper to them with their assumd titles of true and absolute proprietaries of the province of pennsylvania which i omitted as not thinking it necessary in a paper the intention of which was only to reduce to a certainty by writing what in conversation i had delivered viva voce but during this delay the assembly having prevailed with govr denny to pass an act taxing the proprietary estate in common with the estates of the people which was the grand point in dispute they omitted answering the message when this act however came over the proprietaries counselled by paris determined to oppose its receiving the royal assent accordingly they petitiond the king in council and a hearing was appointed in which two lawyers were employd by them against the act and two by me in support of it they alledgd that the act was intended to load the proprietary estate in order to spare those of the people and that if it were sufferd to continue in force and the proprietaries who were in odium with the people left to their mercy in proportioning the taxes they would inevitably be ruined we replyd that the act had no such intention and would have no such effect that the assessors were honest and discreet men under an oath to assess fairly and equitably and that any advantage each of them might expect in lessening his own tax by augmenting that of the proprietaries was too trifling to induce them to perjure themselves this is the purport of what i remember as urged by both sides except that we insisted strongly on the mischievous consequences that must attend a repeal for that the money l being printed and given to the kings use expended in his service and now spread among the people the repeal would strike it dead in their hands to the ruin of many and the total discouragement of future grants and the selfishness of the proprietors in soliciting such a general catastrophe merely from a groundless fear of their estate being taxed too highly was insisted on in the strongest terms on this lord mansfield one of the counsel rose and beckoning me took me into the clerks chamber while the lawyers were pleading and asked me if i was really of opinion that no injury would be done the proprietary estate in the execution of the act i said certainly then says he you can have little objection to enter into an engagement to assure that point i answerd none at all he then calld in paris and after some discourse his lordships proposition was accepted on both sides a paper to the purpose was drawn up by the clerk of the council which i signd with mr charles who was also an agent of the province for their ordinary affairs when lord mansfield returned to the council chamber where finally the law was allowed to pass some changes were however recommended and we also engaged they should be made by a subsequent law but the assembly did not think them necessary for one years tax having been levied by the act before the order of council arrived they appointed a committee to examine the proceedings of the assessors and on this committee they put several particular friends of the proprietaries after a full enquiry they unanimously signd a report that they found the tax had been assessd with perfect equity the assembly looked into my entering into the first part of the engagement as an essential service to the province since it secured the credit of the paper money then spread over all the country they gave me their thanks in form when i returnd but the proprietaries were enraged at governor denny for having passd the act and turnd him out with threats of suing him for breach of instructions which he had given bond to observe he however having done it at the instance of the general and for his majestys service and having some powerful interest at court despisd the threats and they were never put in execution    unfinished
